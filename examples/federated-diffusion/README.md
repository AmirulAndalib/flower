# Flower x Diffusers, Federated Diffusion model training

This example demonstrate how to implement federated learning for training diffusion models using `Flower` and `Diffusers`.

## Centralized Diffusion model

First, we will consider the centralized setting for training a diffusion model.

## Federating the example

Then, we will see how to federate this training over multiple clients.

### Writing the client

We first need to write our `FlowerClient`.

### Writing the strategy

Then we will write a custom strategy.
